# 🐧 RHEL Session Log – August 3, 2025

## 🔍 What I Explored
- Ran `journalctl -b` to view boot logs
- Analyzed BIOS-e820 memory mappings
- Noted SMBIOS messages and DMI strings
- Identified what clean logs vs red flags look like
- Shut down my Red Hat VM cleanly using `sudo shutdown now`

## 💡 What I Learned
- What `To Be Filled By OEM` means in DMI output
- What `auditd` is and why it matters for GRC logging
- How malicious cron jobs can look (e.g., curl payloads)
- What healthy timestamps and BIOS handoff look like
- How to explain this in an audit-ready way

## 🧠 What I’d Do Differently Next Time
- Take terminal screenshots during the session
- Copy terminal output into my markdown notes before shutdown
- Possibly try `journalctl --list-boots` to compare multiple reboots

## 💬 Reflection
Even without screenshots, I made real progress. I understood the structure of my boot log, asked critical questions, and committed my learning to GitHub. Next time, I’ll capture more evidence — but today, I leveled up.
